# Confusion_matrix
Functions to aid with the visualisation of classification accuracy and class purity

Functions will be for summarising confusion matrices from K-fold cross-validation received as an array of
K matrices (where K is the number of 'folds') and 
Each matrix within the array has the dimensions of k x k (where k is the number of classes)

Tables returned have the sensitivity of classification for each class and/or across classes

Plots returned have the sensitivity of the classification for each class and/or across classes
